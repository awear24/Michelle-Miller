created persona

## Milestone 1 Feedback
You've done a very nice job defining your persona in depth and detail - well done. The Use Case could be better  clarified - it is not entirely clear regarding HOW your Persona will be using your PWP.

What I am missing here in your Milestone 1 are the Purpose, Audience and Goal sections as outlined in the documentation and Sample Milestones. This is where you outline YOUR Purpose and Goals for this project, since you are the primary stakeholder here. Your Persona is well defined, but a high-level statement regarding your primary audience as a whole would be helpful. (E.g., "Prolific fine artists in the state of New Mexico who need online and social media solutions for marketing outreach...")

Please see the following pages for instructions and examples:
- https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/
- https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/

Unfortunately because those sections are missing I cannot consider this Milestone complete. Based on our conversations I know know for certain that you have a clear and well-defined direction and purpose for this project, but it's important to be able to document and communicate this clearly to define scope for web projects that you may be involved in going forward - either with clients of your own or employers.

There are also some technical errors - and especially with the directory structure as I see it on GitHub. What I see on the server is a different story though - I see a correct directory structure that hasn't been committed and pushed.  Overall your HTML is looking good however! There was only one minor technical issue with your HTML. Please see Edits &amp; Suggestions below for all technical issues.

Unfortunately because this Milestone was late, there were missing sections (missing Purpose, Audience, Goal), and there were technical errors, I can only pass this Milestone at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). 

*I do give you the green light to begin on Milestone 2a however. Complete the fixes outlined below by Wed. July 26th, 8:00 a.m. and I will bump your grade to Tier II.*

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Directory structure that I see on GitHub does not match what is deployed on the server. Please be sure all changes are committed and pushed. I really should be basing my evaluation on the GitHub repository alone, and this shows incorrect directory structure (the `michelle miller/`` directory pushed 4 days ago).
- Rename `/Documentation` to `/documentation` - with a lower-case "d". All file and directory names should be lower-case, according to the style guide.
- Image file name is incorrect - remove all spaces from the file name.
- add /vendor to the .gitignore file
- `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag is missing from your HTML document.
